      "moreinfo":"Pots and Planters have gained immense recognition for sprucing our offices and homes. However, planters are much more than an aesthetic piece. A garden planter with proper drainage holes and apt size ensures the well-being of the soil and plant by preventing waterlogging and moisture retention. Although, there is a wide variety of materials to choose from for a planter. Yet, metal planters and ceramic planters have topped the list. Both have their own advantages and demerits that often confuse a buyer. In this article, we have discussed both the planters and the major differences between them along with some maintenance tips to keep your planters intact and plants healthy.",
      "steps":"Crafted with high-end metals like stainless steel, iron, or galvanised steel metal planters are perfect for your contemporary interiors. These are majorly used for cultivating plants, small trees or shrubs. Available in a multitude of sizes, shapes and styles, metal planters are a great choice for gardens, balconies and interiors as well. Unlike other planters, they are a sturdy and long-term investment for your garden. Metal planters offer remarkable durability, moisture resistance, chipping and cracking. The only demerit with these planters is that they heat up very quickly. Therefore, to maintain the ideal temperature of the soil one needs to line them with protective coatings.Ceramic planters are crafted with ceramic which is a natural clay that is baked at high temperature. The baking accounts for its high durability and prolonged life. Ceramic planters have gained immense popularity over time as they are available in a wide range of sizes, shapes, colours and designs. Due to this, they suit various aesthetics and preferences from traditional or modern. "
